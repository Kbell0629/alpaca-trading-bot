# CLAUDE.md — Session Context

One-page answer to: what is this, what's the current state, how do I pick up?
Full history lives in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## What this is

Autonomous multi-user stock-trading bot. Screens ~12K US equities every 30 min,
auto-deploys top picks across 6 strategies, manages exits, handles kill-switch
+ drawdown guardrails, runs 24/7 on Railway.

- **Dashboard:** https://stockbott.up.railway.app
- **Repo:** `Kbell0629/alpaca-trading-bot`
- **Primary branch:** `main` (protected: PR + CI required, no force push)
- **Agent branch pattern:** `claude/<short-description>` → PR → squash-merge
- **Sessions:** paper-trading 30-day validation (started 2026-04-15, ends ~2026-05-15).
  Live-trading path wired but off.

## Alpaca account state

- Paper $100k seed, live toggleable via Settings → 🔴 Live Trading (OFF).
- `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` **required** on Railway (auth.py refuses boot without).
- `SENTRY_DSN`, `NTFY_TOPIC`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` set on Railway.

---

## Picking up a session

1. `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only`
2. `cat CLAUDE.md` (this file), `cat README.md`, `cat CHANGELOG.md`
3. `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c 'print("e"*64)') python3 -m pytest tests/ --deselect tests/test_dashboard_data.py::test_trading_session_is_computed_live_not_from_stale_json --deselect tests/test_auth.py::test_password_strength_rejects_weak --deselect tests/test_audit_round12_scheduler_latent.py::test_ruff_clean_on_real_bug_rules -q`
   — expect **1490 passing, 3 deselected** after round-61 pt.8 Option B.
4. `ruff check .` — clean.
5. Validate dashboard JS: `awk '/^<script>/,/^<\/script>/' templates/dashboard.html | grep -v '^<script>' | grep -v '^</script>' > /tmp/dash.js && node --check /tmp/dash.js`
6. `npm ci && npx vitest run` — expect **341 JS tests passing** (29 files).
   Run `node --check static/dashboard_render_core.js` after any edit to
   the extracted module.

**GitHub MCP reconnects late in some sessions.** Use web UI for PRs when
`mcp__github__*` tools aren't in the tool list. PRs that modify
`.github/workflows/*.yml` require one-click workflow approval at
https://github.com/Kbell0629/alpaca-trading-bot/actions before CI runs.

---

## Audit playbook (when user says "check for bugs")

1. Read this file + `git log --oneline main | head -30`.
2. Spawn 5 parallel Explore agents: security, DB/concurrency, trading logic,
   UI/UX/mobile, tests/ops. Give each <1000-word reply budget.
3. Triage: auto-fix clear wins in ONE PR; flag architecturally significant
   ones for user decision.
4. `ruff check . --select F821,B023` — historically surfaces real bugs
   (undefined names, loop captures).
5. **Verify every trading-logic claim against actual code** — that agent has
   a history of false positives (CHANGELOG round-22 + round-52 logged 8+
   each round that turned out to be misreadings).
6. Deliver report: "fixed", "needs your decision", "deferred".

## Current session state (2026-04-24 — round 61 pt.8 CLOSE-OUT / batch-10 in flight)

**Option B extraction landed (PR #132).** A new file
`static/dashboard_render_core.js` now holds 19 pure helpers that used
to live inline in `templates/dashboard.html`. Same pattern pt.7 used
to extract `screener_core.py` / `scorecard_core.py` from subprocess
drivers. Loaded via `<script src="/static/dashboard_render_core.js">`
BEFORE the big inline script; each function attaches to `window` for
backward compat with the ~9300 lines of inline code that still call
them as free globals. Test loader (`tests/js/loadDashboardJs.js`)
reads both files; new direct-import loader (`tests/js/loadRenderCore.js`)
lets tests hit the extracted module in isolation.

**Extracted so far (19 helpers, 56 direct-import tests):**
  * XSS: `esc`, `jsStr`
  * Formatters: `fmtMoney`, `fmtPct`, `pnlClass`, `fmtUpdatedET`,
    `fmtAuditTime`, `fmtRelative`
  * OCC parser: `_occParse`
  * Scheduler: `SCHEDULED_TIME_MAP`, `parseSchedTs`, `latestForTask`,
    `fmtSchedLast`
  * Regime / heatmap / freshness: `getMarketRegime`, `heatmapColor`,
    `freshnessChip`
  * Preset detection: `detectActivePreset`
  * README sanitizer: `_sanitizeReadmeHtml` + `_README_ALLOWED_TAGS`
    + `_README_ALLOWED_ATTRS`

**batch-10 in flight** (branch `claude/round-61-pt8-batch10`):
extending the extraction to the remaining panel-render helpers —
`buildGuardrailMeters`, `buildTodaysClosesPanel`, `buildNextActionsPanel`,
`buildStrategyTemplates`, `buildShortStrategyCard`, `buildComparisonPanel`,
`sectionHelpButton`, `getHiddenSections` + friends. Each either already
returns an HTML string OR is trivially wrappable with `opts` defaults
that pull module-local `guardrailsData` / `autoDeployerEnabled` /
`killSwitchActive` from `window`. No behavior change. Adds another
~60-80 direct tests.

**Extraction bug caught during Option B:** the original inline `jsStr`
escaped `&` → `&`; the first draft of the extraction missed it.
Fixed before any inline duplicate was removed. Regression-guard test
now exists.

**Pt.8 follow-ups (future PRs):**
  * After batch-10 lands, add Vitest `--coverage` with a threshold
    floor in CI (similar to Python's `--cov-fail-under`).
  * Pt.9 — deeper `cloud_scheduler.py` coverage (still ~31% after
    pt.6). 60+ internal functions unexplored.

## Previous session state (2026-04-24 — round 61 pt.8 BATCH-3)

**Pt.8 batch-3 on `claude/round-61-pt8-batch3`.** Pure test-only
PR. JS tests 99 → **136** (+37) across 4 new files:
  * `toast` (16) — info/success/error/warning branches, XSS on
    message + correlation ID, retry-button callback + removal,
    retry-throws-swallowed, `toastFromApiError` dispatch paths.
  * `log` (8) — newest-first order, type→class, XSS escape, 20-
    entry visible cap, Round-57 hash-skip quiet-tick pin.
  * `fmtRelative` (8) — "just now" / "Xm" / "Xh" / "Xd" bucket
    boundaries, unix-seconds input, "future" / "never" / garbage.
  * `scrollToSection` (5) — Round-53 active-tab + `_activeNavSection`
    pins.

Loader now exposes `toastFromApiError` + `fmtRelative`. `let`-scoped
module state (activityLog) still not resetable — tests assert on
relative position instead of absolute counts.

**Pt.8 follow-ups (future PRs):** renderPortfolioImpact.colorFor
math, openClosePositionModal OCC breakdown math (short put
assignment, covered call assignment), possibly JS coverage
threshold in CI once a stable floor is established.

---

## Previous session state (2026-04-24 — round 61 pt.8 BATCH-2)

**Pt.8 batch-2 on `claude/round-61-pt8-batch2`.** Builds on the
kickoff (#122). JS tests 68 → 99 (+31) across 3 new files:
`atomicReplaceChildren` (9, pins all 5 jitter-fix failure modes),
`freshnessChip` (12, pins the post-60 `data-label` invariant +
age-tier classes + XSS escape), `focusables` (10, `_focusablesIn`
for modal keyboard accessibility).

**Loader fix:** stubs `setTimeout` alongside `setInterval` so the
dashboard's delayed `measureStickyHeader(500ms)` doesn't fire after
jsdom teardown. Silences the "document is not defined" async
uncaught-exception noise that was flagging every batch with a
spurious "1 error" summary.

**User-reported AUTO/MANUAL fix:** screenshot showed CRDO / DKNG put
/ HIMS put / INTC / SOXL all labeled MANUAL. Root cause for the
wheel puts: `wheel_strategy.py:791` writes
`deployer="wheel_auto_deploy"` to the journal, but
`server._mark_auto_deployed`'s allowlist only recognized three
values. Added `"wheel_auto_deploy"` to the tuple + source + behavioral
pins. Equity positions use `"cloud_scheduler"` (already in list) —
if still MANUAL it's a stale-file + trimmed-journal edge case.

**Pt.8 follow-ups (next PRs):** renderDashboard core path,
openClosePositionModal wheel option math (short put assignment,
covered call), scroll helpers, toast / log. Add JS coverage
threshold to CI once we have a stable floor.

---

## Previous session state (2026-04-24 — round 61 pt.8 KICKOFF)

**Pt.8 (Vitest + jsdom for dashboard JS) kicked off on
`claude/round-61-pt8-vitest`.** Lands the JS test infrastructure
that pt.5/6/7 couldn't reach: ~7000 LOC of inline JS in
`templates/dashboard.html` is finally testable.

  * `package.json` + `vitest.config.js` + `tests/js/loadDashboardJs.js`
    — extracts the inline `<script>` from dashboard.html, runs it in
    jsdom via `vm.runInThisContext` so its top-level `function`
    declarations attach to the global scope. Stubs out Chart/marked
    CDN libs, no-op-ifies setInterval, scaffolds toastContainer/app/
    logPanel DOM nodes, swallows the auto-`fetch()` so `init()`
    doesn't pollute test output.
  * 4 starter test files (68 tests passing): esc/jsStr (XSS escapes),
    fmtMoney/fmtPct/pnlClass/fmtUpdatedET (format helpers), `_occParse`
    (OCC option-symbol parser), parseSchedTs/latestForTask
    (scheduler timestamp helpers).
  * CI extended: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds Node 20 setup +
    `npm ci` + `npm test` step after the existing pytest job.

**Two user-reported regressions piggybacked in this PR:**
  * Mobile admin → Users table: buttons stacked vertically (40px
    each × 6 actions = 240px+ per row). Wrapped in `.admin-actions`
    flex-wrap container, hide Email/Logins on mobile, hide
    Role/Last-Login on ultra-narrow.
  * Paper-vs-Live "Win Rate 0%" anchored on missing
    `win_rate_reliable` API field. Both panels now defensive: derive
    reliability from `closed_trades >= 5` directly so the post-60
    invariant ("show N=X, Need 5+ when sample is small") holds even
    when the backend field is missing/wrong.

**Pt.8 follow-ups (next PRs):** ratchet JS coverage by adding more
test files (renderDashboard core, openClosePositionModal OCC math,
atomicReplaceChildren scroll preservation). Then add a JS coverage
threshold to CI similar to Python's `--cov-fail-under`.

---

## Previous session state (2026-04-24 — round 61 pt.7 CLOSE-OUT)

**Pt.7 kickoff (#119) + follow-up (claude/continue-pt7-xEG9a) both
landed.** `screener_core.py` and `scorecard_core.py` both exist,
both are outside the coverage omit list, both have dedicated
behavioral test files:
  * `tests/test_round61_pt7_screener_core.py` — 62 tests covering
    `pick_best_entry_strategy`, `trading_day_fraction_elapsed`,
    `score_stocks` (breakout/wheel/mean-reversion tiers, volatility
    soft-cap, injected copy + pead score-fns with exception swallow,
    sector + sort), `apply_market_regime`,
    `apply_sector_diversification`, `calc_position_size`,
    `compute_portfolio_pnl`. 98% line+branch coverage.
  * `tests/test_round61_pt7_scorecard_core.py` — 85 tests covering
    Decimal helpers, status counts, win/loss stats, profit factor,
    max drawdown (three-way peak), Sharpe + Sortino, strategy
    breakdown, A/B testing, correlation-warning (injected annotator),
    readiness, snapshot retention, full orchestrator via
    `calculate_metrics` + `take_daily_snapshot`. 99% line+branch.
  * Round-58 pin (`test_correlation_warning_resolves_option_underlying`)
    updated to grep both files — update_scorecard.py for the
    injected annotator import, scorecard_core.py for the
    `_underlying`/`_sector` grouping logic.
  * **Coverage 51.04% → ~53%; CI floor 45 → 48.** Floor leaves
    headroom above local measurements for CI-environment drift.
  * Test count 1392 → **1484** (3 deselected unchanged).

### Mock WSGI harness (post-pt.6 — use it for any HTTP endpoint test)

The `http_harness` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` is the template for
every future HTTP-endpoint test. Usage:

```python
def test_my_endpoint(http_harness):
    http_harness.create_user()  # seeds user #1 as admin, gets cookie + CSRF
    resp = http_harness.get("/api/my-endpoint")
    assert resp["status"] == 200
    assert resp["body"]["foo"] == "bar"
    # Or for POSTs (CSRF + JSON body auto-injected):
    resp = http_harness.post("/api/my-endpoint", body={"k": "v"})
```

`resp` shape: `{"status": int, "headers": dict, "headers_list": list,
"body": parsed-json-or-str, "raw": bytes}`. The fixture also includes
`http_harness.logout()` to drop the session for anonymous-access tests.

The pattern for the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` subclass override (skip
`__init__`, override `send_response`/`send_header`/`end_headers` to
record instead of socket-write) lives in the fixture — next agents
don't need to re-derive it.

### Module coverage milestones

- `server.py` 7% → **47%** (via mock WSGI harness, pt.6 + follow-ups)
- `handlers/admin_mixin.py` 0% → **74%** (admin-and-target pattern exercises real user IDs)
- `handlers/actions_mixin.py` 0% → **56%** (kill-switch, force-deploy, force-daily-close, refresh)
- `handlers/strategy_mixin.py` 0% → **49%** (deploy validation, pause/stop, apply-preset, toggle-short-selling)
- `handlers/auth_mixin.py` 0% → **49%** (login/signup/logout, password change, settings update, invite consumption)
- `scheduler_api.py` 41% → ~85% • `yfinance_budget.py` 61% → 92%
- `wheel_strategy.py` 33% → 47% (helpers covered; state-machine
  transitions still grep-pinned only)
- `pdt_tracker.py` 60% → >90% • `settled_funds.py` 76% → >90%
- `fractional.py` 60% → >80%
- `cloud_scheduler.py` ~31% (mostly flat — pt.6 didn't touch it
  directly; behavioral tests hit kill-switch + drawdown paths only.
  A future pt could target the 60+ remaining fns in this file.)

### Scroll-jitter fix history (FIVE rounds — mandatory reading before touching refresh)

The jitter took five iterative fixes because it came from five
independent failure modes. **All five remain necessary; do not
"simplify" any of them.** When the user reports refresh-related
issues, check this list first — most likely the same patterns.

1. **R60** — added `_lastAppNormHash` to `renderDashboard` stripping
   timestamps from the hash so quiet ticks skip `#app.innerHTML` swap.
2. **R61 #107** — extended the same regex to strip `$X.XX` and `±X.X%`
   from the hash. Price-tick-only changes now flow through the quiet
   branch instead of triggering full rewrites every 10s.
3. **R61 #108** — added CSS `contain: layout style` + `overflow-anchor:
   auto` on every refreshing section. Plus normalized hash-skip in
   `refreshFactorHealth` (it embeds a freshness chip that was making
   the panel rewrite every 10s). Browser-native containment so panel-
   internal updates don't reflow siblings.
4. **R61 #109** — atomic children swap for `#app`: parse new HTML into
   a `<template>` element, then transfer via `replaceChildren` in one
   atomic DOM op. `#app.innerHTML = x` was destroying children first
   then rebuilding, leaving an empty-frame where document height
   collapsed and the browser clamped scrollY. Plus `#app { min-height:
   100vh; overflow-anchor: auto; }` as a second line of defense.
5. **R61 #111** — preserve **async-populated panel content** across
   the `#app` swap. Snapshot each async panel's current `innerHTML`
   before `replaceChildren`, transplant into the new template's matching
   placeholder. User was seeing "Loading scheduler status" flash
   during refresh because the new `#app` shell had empty placeholders
   for `schedulerPanel`, `factorHealthPanel`, etc.
6. **R61 #113** — atomic children swap **at the panel level too**.
   `renderSchedulerPanel`, `refreshPerfAttribution`, `refreshTaxReport`,
   `refreshFactorHealth` were all using `panel.innerHTML = html`
   directly. Same empty-frame bug as #109, just one level deeper.
   New helper `atomicReplaceChildren(panelEl, newHtml)` does the
   `<template>` + `replaceChildren` swap AND preserves descendant
   `scrollTop` (so `.sched-log-box` internal scroll stays put).

If jitter resurfaces on a NEW area, check whether it's a 6th failure
mode or a regression of one of the above. The pinning tests are in
`tests/test_round61_pt6_prep_*.py` — they assert source patterns so
a refactor that "simplifies" any of these will fail loudly.

### Bug fixes from the live-traffic shakedown (must-not-regress)

- **#110 — `[orphan]` close tag**: `error_recovery.py` now appends a
  `trade_journal.json` open entry alongside any strategy file it
  creates. Without this, when the recovered position later closes via
  stop-trigger, `record_trade_close` can't find a matching open and
  falls into the synthetic `orphan_close` path. Look for
  `auto_recovered=True` flag on backfilled opens.
- **#110 — `_mark_auto_deployed` skips closed strategy files**: stale
  `trailing_stop_SOXL.json` (status=closed) was claiming the SOXL
  symbol over the active `short_sell_SOXL.json`. Status-skip list:
  `closed/stopped/cancelled/canceled/exited/filled_and_closed`. Also:
  `short_sell` priority bumped to 2 (same tier as `trailing_stop`).
- **#114 — AUTO/MANUAL journal fallback**: `_mark_auto_deployed` now
  falls back to `trade_journal.json` when no strategy file matches.
  Recognizes `deployer in (cloud_scheduler, wheel_strategy,
  error_recovery)`. Walks newest→oldest with `setdefault` so the
  most-recent open wins on re-opens. Strategy files still preferred
  when both exist. Option positions try BOTH the OCC contract symbol
  and the underlying for the journal lookup.
- **#112 — Email diagnostics**: new `/api/email-status` endpoint
  returns `{enabled, queued, sent_today, failed_recent, last_sent_at,
  recipient, dead_letter_count}`. Dashboard 📧 header chip shows
  state at a glance: 📧 OFF (red, SMTP creds missing), 📧 NO ADDR
  (orange, recipient not set), 📧 N STUCK (orange, >10 unsent), 📧
  N queued (dim), 📧 N today (green). Click to see full diagnostic.
  Short force-cover now emails (`exit` not `info`).

### Road to 80% coverage (the path forward)

| Phase | Target | Scope | Est effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **pt.5** | 39% | scheduler_api + yfinance_budget + helper modules | 1 PR | ✅ done |
| **pt.6** | ~65% | **Mock WSGI harness for `server.py` + `handlers/*.py`.** Biggest lever left — `server.py` was 1708 statements at 7%. Built the harness in `tests/conftest.py::http_harness` + 260 endpoint tests across #116 (base) + #117 (follow-ups). Landed at **51%** total (below the 65% target because cloud_scheduler.py is still ~31% — not within pt.6's scope). | 2 PRs, 1 day | ✅ done (51% actual) |
| **pt.7** | ~78% | Refactor `update_dashboard.py` + `update_scorecard.py` to extract pure scoring math into `screener_core.py` / `scorecard_core.py`. Un-omit from coverage. Requires source changes — needs careful review. | 1-2 PRs, 2-3 days | **in progress** — `screener_core.py` landed via #119; behavioral tests + `scorecard_core.py` still to do |
| **pt.8 (optional, parallel)** | adds JS coverage | Vitest + jsdom for `templates/dashboard.html`'s ~6000 LOC. Without this, Python-only caps ~78%. | 1 PR, 1-2 days | optional |
| **pt.9 (stretch)** | `cloud_scheduler.py` deeper | Still ~31% after pt.6 because pt.6 focused on the HTTP surface. Could add behavioral tests for the 60+ remaining scheduler functions (run_daily_close, process_strategy_file branches, wheel orchestration). Adds +5-8 points. | 1 PR, ~1 day | future |

### pt.6 DONE — harness + test pattern reference

The harness lives at `tests/conftest.py::http_harness`. Five test files
use it and should be the template for any future HTTP-endpoint test:
  * `tests/test_round61_pt6_harness_smoke.py` — 6 smoke tests
  * `tests/test_round61_pt6_wsgi_endpoints.py` — 76 auth-gate + shape
  * `tests/test_round61_pt6_wsgi_authed_flows.py` — 82 authed flows
  * `tests/test_round61_pt6_strategy_mixin_flows.py` — 21 deploy paths
  * `tests/test_round61_pt6_followup_admin_actions.py` — 57 admin flows

Usage:

```python
def test_my_endpoint(http_harness):
    http_harness.create_user()  # user #1 is auto-admin
    resp = http_harness.get("/api/my-endpoint")
    assert resp["status"] == 200
    assert resp["body"]["foo"] == "bar"
    # POSTs auto-inject CSRF cookie + header:
    resp = http_harness.post("/api/my-endpoint", body={"k": "v"})
```

For admin tests, use the **admin-and-target pattern** (see
`test_round61_pt6_followup_admin_actions.py::TestAdminSetActive._create_admin_and_target`):
create admin1 + target user, logout, re-auth as admin so admin
endpoints have a real target user ID to operate on.

### pt.7 DONE — screener_core + scorecard_core both extracted + tested

**Both cores shipped:**
  * `screener_core.py` (7 pure fns, extracted #119, 98% coverage via
    62 tests in `tests/test_round61_pt7_screener_core.py`)
  * `scorecard_core.py` (17 pure fns, extracted in the pt.7 follow-up,
    99% coverage via 85 tests in
    `tests/test_round61_pt7_scorecard_core.py`)

`update_dashboard.py` and `update_scorecard.py` stay in `omit` list
(both still serve as subprocess entry points); both import from the
respective core modules via thin compat wrappers that inject
production dependencies (`now_et`, `constants.SECTOR_MAP`,
`position_sector.annotate_sector`).

**Coverage impact:** 51.04% → ~53%. CI floor ratcheted 45 → 48.
Test count 1392 → 1484.

**For the next agent — how to extend this pattern:** if you need to
test previously-omitted subprocess logic, mirror the pt.7 approach:
extract pure math into a new `*_core.py` module, pass external deps
as callable parameters, have the caller wrap the core function and
inject production dependencies. The caller stays in `omit` (it's
still subprocess-driven), the core module is NOT omitted, and
pytest-cov sees the math. Behavior stays identical because the
wrapper is a 1:1 passthrough.

### Structural limits (won't go away with more Python tests)

- **Dashboard JS (~6000 LOC) is invisible to `pytest-cov`.** Until
  pt.8 (Vitest), total coverage caps around 75-80% even with perfect
  Python. Test quality is still improving; the number is just capped.
- **Subprocess-driven modules** (`update_dashboard.py`,
  `update_scorecard.py`, `capital_check.py`) need the un-omit
  refactor before coverage even counts them.
- **`server.py` now 47%** — pt.6 moved the big lever. Further gains
  on server.py from here need either pt.7 (refactor) or more happy-
  path tests that drive Alpaca-facing code (stubbed).

### Picking up pt.8 / pt.9 (checklist for next session)

1. `git pull --ff-only origin main`
2. `cat CLAUDE.md` (this section first — it's the current plan)
3. `cat CHANGELOG.md` (skim last 3 rounds)
4. Confirm tests pass: `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(python3 -c 'print("a"*64)') pytest tests/ --deselect tests/test_dashboard_data.py::test_trading_session_is_computed_live_not_from_stale_json --deselect tests/test_auth.py::test_password_strength_rejects_weak --deselect tests/test_audit_round12_scheduler_latent.py::test_ruff_clean_on_real_bug_rules -q` — expect **1484 passing, 3 deselected**
5. Decide next step. Options:
   * **pt.8** (Vitest for dashboard JS, ~6000 LOC currently invisible
     to pytest-cov — adds JS coverage, pushes total past ~78%)
   * **pt.9** (deeper `cloud_scheduler.py` — still ~31%; pt.6 hit the
     HTTP surface but left 60+ scheduler fns behind)
   * Source-level refactors of other subprocess-driven files (e.g.
     `capital_check.py`) using the same `*_core.py` extract pattern.

### Previously in-flight (now merged)
Rounds 54-60 all merged via PRs #97-#101, 2026-04-22 / 2026-04-23.
Round-61 pt.1-3 merged via #102/#103/#104, 2026-04-23.
Round-57 audit sweep (detailed below) was the last big regression-fix
round before the coverage-testing sprint.

### Round-57 — Full tech-stack audit fixes
5 parallel Explore agents ran. 13 real bugs triaged, 3 false positives verified.

**Concurrency (4 unlocked `guardrails.json` RMW sites fixed):**
- `cloud_scheduler.py:1891` — stop-triggered `last_loss_time` write now
  inside `strategy_file_lock(gpath)`.
- `cloud_scheduler.py:2857` — `run_daily_close` `daily_starting_value` +
  `peak_portfolio_value` update now locked. Fetches `/account` OUTSIDE
  the lock (100-500ms network call would block the monitor otherwise).
- `server.py` `/api/calibration/override` + `/api/calibration/reset` —
  both handlers now wrap RMW in `strategy_file_lock`. Tier detection
  runs OUTSIDE the lock for same reason.

**Rate limit:** `/api/calibration/override` per-user cooldown = 3s
(`_CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE_LAST_WRITE` module dict). Scripted loops / double-
clicks return HTTP 429 + `rate_limited:true`.

**Observability:** Failed trailing-stop raises now call
`observability.capture_message("trailing_stop_raise_failed", ...)` with
`session` (AH vs market) + `symbol` + attempted new_stop. Operator can
debug in Sentry UI instead of scrolling logs.

**UX:**
- `<input type="range">` CSS: 32px container height, 22px custom thumb
  with `accent-color: var(--blue)` + WCAG-AA contrast on dark bg.
  iOS users can actually drag them now.
- Dashboard header: `⚡ AH TRAILING` chip renders during pre/post-market
  when `guardrails.extended_hours_trailing != false`. User can see the
  bot is actively watching, not sleeping.
- Calibration hierarchy text wrapper: `role="note" aria-live="polite"
  aria-atomic="true"` so screen readers announce it.

**Data exposure:** `/api/data` now returns `extended_hours_trailing`
(defaults True) so the dashboard can render the AH chip.

**Tests:** 14 new in `tests/test_round57_audit_fixes.py` — lock presence
grep-level pins, 429 response pin, Sentry breadcrumb pin, daily-close
`portfolio_value=None/0` runtime edge cases, slider touch-height CSS,
AH chip HTML. 779 passing total (was 765 pre-round-57), 2 deselected.
Ruff clean. Dashboard JS `node --check` clean.

### Previously in-flight (now merged)
Round-54 (calibration overrides + jitter fix) + round-55 (AH trailing)
+ round-56 (daily-close email OCC option labeling) all merged via
PR #97, commit `a10d00b`, 2026-04-22.

### Round-54 — Calibration per-key overrides + desktop jitter fix
- `POST /api/calibration/override` — whitelist + range validation + Alpaca-rule
  blocks (cash can't enable shorts, margin <$25k can't disable PDT, etc.)
- `POST /api/calibration/reset` — reverts tier-adopted keys only (preserves
  user risk-preference keys: daily_loss_limit_pct, earnings_exit, kill_switch)
- Settings → Calibration tab: sliders + toggles + strategy pills + warnings
- **Jitter FIX**: `window._lastAppHtml` hash-skip — only touches
  `app.innerHTML` when output string differs. Zero repaint on quiet ticks.
- 11 new tests in `test_round54_calibration_overrides.py`

### Round-55 — After-hours trailing-stop tightening
- Monitor every 5 min in pre-market (4–9:30 AM ET) + post-market (4–8 PM ET),
  **stops-only mode**.
- Trailing-stop raise fires on AH pops; stop order stays GTC + triggers at
  next regular-hours cross.
- AH mode SKIPS: daily-loss kill-switch, initial stop placement, profit-take
  ladder, mean-reversion, PEAD, earnings-exit, short-sells, wheel files
  (thin-book paths).
- Opt-out: `guardrails.extended_hours_trailing = false` (default True).
- 10 new tests in `test_round55_after_hours_trailing.py`

### Round-56 daily-close email (merged as part of PR #97)
User forwarded an email screenshot showing `HIMS260508P00027000 ... (-1 sh)`
which should have read as `HIMS put 260508 $27 ... (short 1 contract)`.
New `_display_label(sym, qty)` closure in `_build_daily_close_report`
detects OCC format and renders underlying + expiry + strike + right +
singular/plural contract noun. 11 tests. Math (%, $, sort) untouched.

## Architectural invariants (CRITICAL — don't regress)

### Post-61 (money-path test coverage — Option A)
- `tests/test_round61_*.py` pin money-path invariants at the source-string
  level. A refactor that renames `strategy_file_lock` or moves the
  `kill_switch` guard will break these — BY DESIGN. Read the failing
  assertion's docstring before "fixing" the test; it documents which
  past bug the invariant prevents.
- `check_profit_ladder` MUST keep the rung order `[10, 20, 30, 50]` at
  25% of `initial_qty` each. Changing this changes every open wheel's
  exit plan — needs a product-level decision, not a refactor.
- `check_profit_ladder` MUST return after firing ONE rung per call.
  Firing all rungs at once on a single spike sells into thin upper-book
  liquidity. The `return  # One level per check` comment is the pin.
- `check_profit_ladder` `client_order_id = ladder-<sym>-L<pct>-<ET_YYYYMMDD>`
  format MUST be stable. Alpaca dedup key depends on it — changing the
  format loses idempotency across a retry window.
- Wheel stage strings (`stage_1_searching`, `stage_1_put_active`,
  `stage_2_shares_owned`, `stage_2_call_active`) are persisted in every
  live `wheel_*.json`. Renaming any of them breaks every existing state
  file on disk. Never rename without a migration.
- Call assignment MUST reset `state["cost_basis"] = None` when
  `shares_owned` hits 0. Without this, the next cycle's assignment math
  inherits stale cost basis → wrong tax lot on every wheel past #1.

### Post-60 (post-deploy user feedback fixes)
- ETFs (SPY/QQQ/SOXL/IBIT/MSOS/XL*/TQQQ/VIXY/GLD/TLT/JETS/ARKK/etc.) MUST short-circuit in `earnings_exit.should_exit_for_earnings` via the `_KNOWN_ETFS` frozenset. They have no earnings — fetching wastes rate limit + emits false-positive Sentry alerts.
- `earnings_exit_fetch_failed` Sentry breadcrumbs MUST dedup per `(symbol, error)` per ET calendar day via `_CAPTURED_TODAY`. The pre-market AH monitor fires 12+ times per hour; without dedup that's 60+ alerts per morning per failing symbol.
- `renderDashboard` MUST compare a *normalised* hash (`_lastAppNormHash`) that strips tick-varying timestamp text. Raw-string hash triggered a full DOM replace on every 10s tick → mobile scroll jitter.
- The in-place patch branch (quiet-tick fallback) MUST update `[title="Last data refresh"]` + `.data-freshness[data-label]` elements via `textContent` / `outerHTML`. Don't touch `innerHTML` of `#app` in this branch — it's the whole point of skipping.
- `freshnessChip(updatedAt, label)` MUST emit `data-label="..."` when label is non-empty so the in-place patch can regenerate the chip.
- Dashboard panels showing win rate (Readiness card + Paper-vs-Live comparison) MUST branch on `sc.win_rate_reliable`. When false, render `N=X` + "Need 5+" prompt — never anchor on alarmist `0%` from a 2-trade sample.
- Position Correlation rows MUST have `min-width:420px` and their wrapper MUST have `overflow-x:auto`. Without these, mobile viewports (≤380px) truncate the dollar column.

### Post-59 (final pre-live fixes)
- `insider_signals.parse_form4_purchase_value` MUST cache parse errors + bad accessions but NOT cache network errors. Form 4s never change post-filing; transient errors deserve retry next screener tick.
- Only transaction code "P" (open-market purchase) counts toward `total_value_usd`. Adding A/M/G/F/S would inflate the number with compensation/exercise/sale events — those aren't bullish signals.
- `_FORM4_XML_BUDGET_PER_CALL = 5` per `fetch_insider_buys`. Lowering loses signal; raising slows every screener run by ~1s per extra fetch.
- `migrations._user_migration_lock` MUST acquire per user (not globally) so one user's slow round-51 fetch doesn't block other users' migrations.
- CI `--cov-fail-under` MUST never decrease. Rounds that add tests should ratchet it up. Currently at 32% (actual 35% per round-61 measurement).

### Post-58 (JSON-audit fixes)
- `update_scorecard` correlation guard MUST route through `position_sector.annotate_sector` (OCC options resolve to underlying for sector lookup).
- `constants.SECTOR_MAP` is the single source of truth. Missing tickers surface as "Other" which breaks the correlation guard — add them here, not in consumers.
- Screener-annotated `will_deploy=False` picks MUST sort after `will_deploy=True` so the "top N" reflects what the deployer will pick up.
- `/api/data` MUST filter picks that have no real screener enrichment (no technical, zero momentum, zero recommended_shares) — the default-value tail is noise.
- `earnings_exit._fetch_next_earnings_from_yfinance` fetch failures MUST stamp `_LAST_FETCH_ERR[symbol]` with a distinct reason, and `should_exit_for_earnings` MUST emit `capture_message(event="earnings_exit_fetch_failed")` on any non-`no_future_unreported` failure. Silent fail-open held INTC through earnings in 2026-04.
- `insider_data.total_value_usd` MUST be `null` (not `0`) — we don't parse Form 4 XML yet, and `0` reads as "no insider buying" when `buy_count > 0`.

### Post-57 (audit fixes)
- Every `guardrails.json` RMW MUST hold `strategy_file_lock(gpath)` across
  read + write. Slow ops (Alpaca `/account` fetches, tier detection) MUST
  happen OUTSIDE the lock.
- `/api/calibration/override` MUST rate-limit at 3s per user/mode (bucket
  in `_CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE_LAST_WRITE`). Don't remove — cheap DoS mitigation.
- Failed trailing-stop raises MUST fire `observability.capture_message`
  with `event=trailing_stop_raise_failed` + `session` tag.
- `/api/data` MUST expose `extended_hours_trailing` (default True) so the
  dashboard AH chip renders correctly.
- `input[type=range]` CSS MUST keep `height: 32px` + `accent-color` +
  custom webkit/moz thumb styling. Browser default is unusable on iOS.

### Post-55 (after-hours monitor)
- `monitor_strategies(user, extended_hours=True)` MUST only raise trailing
  stops. No new buys, profit-takes, short covers. `test_ah_mode_skips_profit_ladder`
  pins the call-site gate.
- AH tick uses `should_run_interval(f"monitor_eh_{uid}", 300)` — 5-min key,
  distinct from 60s `monitor_{uid}`.

### Post-54 (calibration overrides + jitter)
- `window._lastAppHtml` hash-skip guards BOTH DOM write AND scroll restore.
- `/api/calibration/override` validates via whitelist + range checks +
  Alpaca-rule block. Don't remove.

### Post-52 (audit fixes)
- `fractional._cache_path`, `settled_funds._ledger_path` MUST raise
  `ValueError` on missing `_data_dir`. The /tmp fallback is gone — a
  programming bug elsewhere should not silently cross-contaminate users.
- All 3 new modules' RMW paths MUST go through module-local `_file_lock(path)`.
- `migrate_guardrails_round51` MUST track `backup_created_this_call` to avoid
  deleting backups created in prior calls.
- Short-sell block in `run_auto_deployer` MUST check `TIER_CFG.short_enabled`
  BEFORE consulting user config. Cash accounts can't override.
- Tier log dedup via `_last_runs` — only log on state change.

### Post-51 (activation for existing users)
- `migrate_guardrails_round51` MUST write backup before overwriting; MUST NOT
  overwrite existing backup file.
- `record_trade_close` MUST only record proceeds when `side="sell"` (long
  close). Short covers (`side="buy"`) do NOT generate settled cash.
- `run_auto_deployer` fractional routing MUST pass `fractional=True` to
  `smart_orders.place_smart_buy` (routes to market).
- PDT guard in `check_profit_ladder` MUST use buffer=1.
- All round-51 hooks MUST fail OPEN on exception — advisory code never blocks trading.

### Post-50 (portfolio calibration)
- `portfolio_calibration.detect_tier` MUST return None for equity <$500.
- Cash accounts MUST NEVER receive `short_enabled=True` even via user override.
- `pdt_tracker.can_day_trade` MUST check `pdt_applies` before consulting
  `day_trades_remaining`.
- `settled_funds.can_deploy` MUST passthrough for margin (no T+1 constraint).
  95% buffer on cash must stay.
- `fractional.size_position` MUST return `order_type_hint='market'` when
  `fractional=True`.
- `server.py` LOC cap 3000 (test_round6). Bump with care.

### Post-48 (cross-user privacy)
- `notify.py` MUST read `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` from env — never hardcode.
  `test_notify_no_longer_has_hardcoded_recipient` fires on regression.
- `cloud_scheduler.notify_user` MUST pass BOTH `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` and
  `DATA_DIR` per-user in subprocess env.
- `email_sender.drain_all` MUST NOT drain shared root queue — quarantine-only.
- `/api/scheduler-status` with `is_admin=True` returns unfiltered ONLY if `?all=1`.
- Enrichment fetches (wheel-status, news-alerts) MUST NOT call
  `renderDashboard()` from .then() callbacks. Store data, let next tick render.

### Post-46 (dual-mode paper + live)
- `auth.user_data_dir(user_id, mode="paper")` default stays `users/<id>/`.
  No migration, back-compat.
- `user["_mode"]` injected by `_build_user_dict_for_mode` is source of truth.
- Dedup keys like `_wheel_deploy_in_flight`, `_cb_state`, `_auth_alert_dates`:
  paper keeps plain `user_id`; live uses `f"{id}:live"`.
- `notify_user` prefixes live messages with `[LIVE]`.
- Session-mode fallback: if `session_mode == "live"` but no live keys saved,
  `check_auth` silently falls back to paper view.

### General
- **ET everywhere**. Never `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`; always
  `from et_time import now_et`.
- **Money always Decimal-internal** on compute paths; float on JSON boundary.
- **Per-user file isolation is security-critical**. Migration from shared
  DATA_DIR is RESTRICTED to `user_id == 1` (bootstrap admin). Regression here
  has caused cross-user auto-trading before.

---

## Deploy mechanics

- Push to `main` → Railway auto-deploys within ~2 min.
- Confirm: `curl https://stockbott.up.railway.app/api/version` — `commit`
  field matches `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- Required Railway env vars: `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (boot-blocking) + Alpaca
  creds.
- Changing `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` **invalidates all stored credentials**.

---

## Stack / conventions

- Python 3.12 (CI), 3.11 (sandbox)
- stdlib-first. External: `cryptography>=42`, `zxcvbn>=4.4.28`, `sentry-sdk`
  (optional), `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`
- SQLite via `sqlite3` for auth/sessions/audit log
- Per-user runtime state in `$DATA_DIR/users/<id>/`
- JSON files: trade journal, wheel state, guardrails, scorecard
- HTTP via `http.server.ThreadingHTTPServer` (no framework)
- Threading for scheduler (no celery/rq)
- Frontend: single `templates/dashboard.html` (~6K LOC inline JS+CSS,
  vanilla, no build). Always `node --check` extracted JS before merging
  (round-27 lesson).

## Known test quirks

- `tests/test_auth.py::test_password_strength_rejects_weak` FAILS locally
  (sandbox lacks zxcvbn, falls back to 8-char min; "password" passes). CI has
  zxcvbn.
- `tests/test_dashboard_data.py::test_trading_session_is_computed_live_not_from_stale_json`
  FAILS locally (sandbox blocks outbound network). CI deselects explicitly.

Both pre-existing and unrelated to any recent PR.

---

## Tests that `importlib.reload()` auth-dependent modules

MUST set `MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` via monkeypatch — pass locally (env var set
in shell) but fail CI. Use the `_reload(monkeypatch)` pattern:

```python
def _reload(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY", "e" * 64)
    for m in ("auth", "scheduler_api", "cloud_scheduler"):
        _sys.modules.pop(m, None)
    import cloud_scheduler
    return cloud_scheduler
```

Round-46 CI hotfix + round-55 tests use this pattern.
